# Party-Planner
Party Planner (arrayList) project for APCS 23-24
For this project, there is a text file with 90 preregistered guests attending a party that has a max capacity of 100 people. The file also includes the companies that employ these people. There are 10 tables and 10 seats at every table. There cannot be more than 1 people from a company at each table. 

Inaddition to the preregistered guests, there will also be 10 walk ins that will have their conpamies checked and their tables and seats assigned. 

I have gotten the parsing and removing extra people functions down but cannot finish the seating and searching part of the project. 11/27

I have finished the project. There is an extra class-Company from earlier iterations that is not used in the final project. 11/29
